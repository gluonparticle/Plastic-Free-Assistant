# Spring Bird üïä: Plastic-Free Shopping Assistant üõç

Spring Bird is a software application aimed at promoting environment friendly shopping practices by providing users with information about the plastic content in products. It analyzes products and offers a rating based on the percentage of plastic found, helping users make informed, sustainable choices while shopping.

## Problem Statement

The issue of plastic pollution stems not from its production but from its irresponsible consumption, management, and recycling. Less than 10% of the world's plastic is actually recycled, leading to environmental pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. **Spring Bird** aims to address this challenge by empowering users to make wise choices while shopping, thereby reducing plastic consumption and promoting environmentally friendly habits.

## Sustainable Development Goals

Spring Bird aligns with the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- **SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities**:
  - Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and waste management.

- **SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production**:
  - Target 12.3: By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains.

## Inspiration

Spring Bird was inspired by the need to spread awareness about plastic pollution and promote sustainable lifestyles. We care deeply about the environment and the well-being of communities worldwide, striving to create a healthier, more sustainable planet for current and future generations.

## Technical Components

### Backend

- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user authentication securely.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Main backend database for real-time storage and synchronization of sustainability rating data.
- **Google Maps API**: Provides location-based services for users and real-time Sustainable Shopping.

### Machine Learning

- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for machine learning models for object segmentation and plastic detection.

### Frontend

- Developed using the **Flutter SDK** to create a seamless user interface for the mobile app.

### Analytics

- **Google Analytics**: Tracks user traffic and provides insights to improve app functionality.

### Google Cloud Platform

- Hosts and manages various backend services, including Firebase and Cloud Firestore.
- Offers scalable and reliable cloud computing resources for application deployment.

## Deployment

The Flutter frontend is compiled into native code for the Android platform. Google Cloud was chosen for deploying the ML model due to its scalability, reliability, and security.

## Challenges Faced

Spring Bird was developed by a team of four members, three of whom were beginners without any previous projects. They faced numerous challenges, including:

- Integrating the Machine Learning model with other components.
- Training the ML model on a large dataset using Google Cloud Storage and Colab Research notebook.
- Troubleshooting errors such as "File Not Found" and unspecified folder paths.
- Learning to save and train model layers on different datasets to prevent data loss.

## Setup the Project

1. Clone the repo ```https://github.com/gluonparticle/Spring-Bird```
2. [Setup Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on your device
3. Run Flutter app

## Conclusion

Despite facing various challenges, the Spring Bird team successfully developed a Plastic-Free Shopping Assistant that aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals and aims to combat plastic pollution through informed consumer choices. By leveraging modern technologies and a commitment to sustainability, Spring Bird strives to contribute to a healthier planet for all.
