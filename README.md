# Spring Bird üïä: Plastic-Free Shopping Assistant üõç

Spring Bird is a software application aimed at promoting environment friendly shopping practices by providing users with information about the plastic content in products. It analyzes products and offers a rating based on the percentage of plastic found, helping users make informed, sustainable choices while shopping.

## Problem Statement

The issue of plastic pollution stems not from its production but from its irresponsible consumption, management, and recycling. Less than 10% of the world's plastic is actually recycled, leading to environmental pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. **Spring Bird** aims to address this challenge by empowering users to make wise choices while shopping, thereby reducing plastic consumption and promoting environmentally friendly habits.
