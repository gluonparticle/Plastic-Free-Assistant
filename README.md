# Spring Bird üïä: Empowering Sustainable Shopping Practices üõç
## Your Plastic-Free Shopping Assistant üå±

Spring Bird is a software application aimed at promoting environment friendly shopping practices by providing users with information about the plastic content in products. It analyzes products and offers a rating based on the percentage of plastic found, helping users make informed, sustainable choices while shopping.

## Purpose

The issue of plastic pollution stems not from its production but from its irresponsible consumption, management, and recycling. Less than 10% of the world's plastic is actually recycled, leading to environmental pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. **Spring Bird** aims to address this challenge by empowering users to make wise choices while shopping, thereby reducing plastic consumption and promoting environmentally friendly habits.

## Technical Components

### Backend

- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user authentication securely.
- **Cloud Firestore**: Main backend database for real-time storage and synchronization of sustainability rating data.
- **Google Maps API**: Provides location-based services for users and real-time Sustainable Shopping.

### Machine Learning

- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for machine learning models for object segmentation and plastic detection.

### Frontend

- Developed using the **Flutter SDK** to create a seamless user interface for the mobile app.

### Analytics

- **Google Analytics**: Tracks user traffic and provides insights to improve app functionality.

### Google Cloud Platform

- Hosts and manages various backend services, including Firebase and Cloud Firestore.
- Offers scalable and reliable cloud computing resources for application deployment.

## Deployment

The Flutter frontend is compiled into native code for the Android platform. Google Cloud was chosen for deploying the ML model due to its scalability, reliability, and security.
